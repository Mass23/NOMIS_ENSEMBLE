# ROCK samples analyses - NOMIS
## Repository for analysing ROCK samples from the NOMIS project

- Limited for now to metaG data

- Outline:

  - Description of ROCK samples across the three domains of life, i.e. eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses
  - Identify and expand on the cold-adaptation strategies of the entire metagenome
  - Evaluate cold-adaptation genes of specific MAGs within the samples
  - Expand on the shared metabolic niches of the prokaryotic MAGs
  - Evaluate metabolic network interactions and functional clusters that allow survival in these streams
  - Inter-kingdom (Euk + prok {+ viruses}) metabolic interactions based on gene abundance
